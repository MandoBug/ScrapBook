## üí° Why I‚Äôm Building This

I‚Äôve always had a passion for coding and a drive to learn by doing. I wanted to build something special for my girlfriend ‚Äî something she could open up anytime, from anywhere, and look back on our memories. This scrapbook is more than just a project. It‚Äôs personal.

At the same time, I wanted to challenge myself technically: build something end-to-end, document the process, and have something meaningful to showcase on my resume.

## Learning In Public

I'm intentionally building this project step-by-step, learning tools and techniques as I go. I‚Äôm researching, reading docs, troubleshooting errors, and asking for help when stuck ‚Äî and documenting it all in commit logs and this README.

If you‚Äôre reviewing this as part of a job application ‚Äî this is my learning process in motion.
